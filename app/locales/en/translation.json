      {
        "q": "Do I need to pay to attend your events?",
        "a": "Most of our regular events are completely free thanks to our sponsors. For larger conferences, we may charge a small fee (typically 5,000-10,000 XOF for students) to cover venue costs, but we always offer scholarships and discounts for those who need them. No one is turned away for lack of funds."
      },
      {
        "q": "I'm new to AI. Where should I start?",
        "a": "Welcome to the community! We recommend starting with our monthly 'AI Basics' workshops and joining our beginner-friendly study groups. Our website also has a resources section with curated learning materials in both French and English. Many members started with no background and are now building ML projects!"
      },
      {
        "q": "How can I become a speaker or workshop facilitator?",
        "a": "We're always looking for passionate speakers! You don't need to be an expert - just knowledgeable about a topic and willing to share. Submit a proposal through our 'Get Involved' page. For first-timers, we offer speaker coaching to help prepare your session."
      },
      {
        "q": "What COVID-19 safety measures do you have in place?",
        "a": "We follow all Benin government health guidelines. In-person events require proof of vaccination or a negative test, and we provide hand sanitizing stations. Many sessions are also streamed online, and we've increased our hybrid event capabilities to accommodate those who prefer remote participation."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can my organization partner with IndabaX Benin?",
        "a": "Absolutely! We collaborate with universities, tech companies, NGOs, and government agencies. Partnership opportunities range from sponsoring events to hosting workshops or providing venues. Contact our partnerships team at partners@indabax-benin.org to discuss possibilities."
      },
      {
        "q": "How can I stay updated about upcoming events?",
        "a": "Join our WhatsApp community (link on homepage), follow us on Twitter @IndabaXBenin, and subscribe to our monthly newsletter. We announce events at least 4-6 weeks in advance, with early-bird registration periods for popular workshops."
